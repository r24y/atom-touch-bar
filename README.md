# r24y-touch-bar

Handy touch controls for Atom.

### Disclaimer

This is a work in progress; it may or may not be usable, and what I add might be useless for other folks. Some of it is super hacky, too; I wrote this in my spare time out of necessity, and didn't spend any particular amount of time on "getting it right".
